Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that enables teams to build, manage, and run even the most demanding containerized workloads without the complexity of infrastructure management, freeing up development teams to innovate faster.

# Use Cases

1. **Application Modernization**
	Simplify application migration and modernization by replatforming VM based applications with minimal refactoring. Preserve existing network dependencies and service references and containerize your workloads without modifying application code or disrupting business operations.
	
2. **Batch Processing**
	Plan, schedule, and run batch computing workloads across AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([[EC2]]), AWS Fargate, and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. 
	
3. **Generative AI**

Build AI applications, automate backend processes, and orchestrate autonomous business workflows across cloud, on-premises, or edge environments. Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate offers strong isolation for agentic workloads, delivering secure, efficient resource management for sensitive AI applications.  
	
4. **Data Processing**
	Ingest, transform, and analyze continuous data flows from multiple sources using Fargate with Amazon ECS, enabling responsive pipelines that adapt to fluctuating workloads and deliver actionable insights with minimal latency.
	
5. **Hybrid Deployments**
	Gain flexibility to run your containerized applications across cloud, on-premises environments and the edge with Amazon ECS Anywhere to accelerate your modernization initiatives.
