Let's break it down

1. As a determiner/pronoun -> meaning not one of the two things or people
	 Example : "Neither answer is correct" - Not the first one, and not the second one.

2. As a conjunction -> used with "nor" to connect two negative ideas
	Example : "I don't like coffee, and neither do i like tea"

3. In short replies
	Used to agree with negative statement
	Example : 
	A : "I don't like horror movies."
	B : "Neither do i"
